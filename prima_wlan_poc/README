***Summary***

One exploitable bug has been fixed in prima wlan driver a few months
ago.

Upstream fix:
https://github.com/sonyxperiadev/prima/commit/4b91219ada9e73c897da2e0ae7bf2ff043dde950

Cyanogenmod's backport fix:
https://github.com/CyanogenMod/android_kernel_sony_msm8960t/commit/d58f1eacbdf55946ec7062ab6e4df462bf30ef32

It was lacking a check for valid length of copy a buffer, which can be
crafted by userspace. The application could communicate with wlan
driver via ioctl() with 0x8bf7 to enter into vulnerable code path.

This issue may leads to a local DoS or privilege escalation. Some
android phone/tablet are still using the vulnerable version of prima
driver. We've aware of android-msm-flo-3.4-marshmallow for Nexus 7(
2013) is affected by this isuee:

Plz review the file:

msm-kernel/drivers/staging/prima/CORE/HDD/src/wlan_hdd_wext.c


Then we've already sent a patch to backport fix for the branch and
still doesn't get any answer yet:
