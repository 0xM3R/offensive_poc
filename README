Any exploitable bug's PoC written by Hardenedlinux community will be
pushed here. This project is for fun and trying to give a little
heads-up to those who don't care the real sense of security.

Bug-->Exploitable bug-->*PoC*-->exploit-->weaponized/reliable exploit

There are numberless bugs pops up every seconds. Just fixing them are
not enough to solve the problem. Security mitigtaion( like
PaX/Grsecurity) is the only way out;-)
